Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Constraints:

0 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 5 * 104
haystack and needle consist of only lower-case English characters.

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if needle in haystack:
            return haystack.index(needle)
        else:
            return -1
